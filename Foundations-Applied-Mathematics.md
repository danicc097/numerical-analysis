# Volume 2: Algorithms, Approximation, and Optimization

## Introduction

An algorithm is the natural evolution of a formula.

### Complexity

(See chapter for temporal and spatial complexity big O analysis of python example algorithms step by step)

- Temporal complexity: based on primite operations (var assignments, arithmetic,
  boolean operations...) that are executed.
- Spatial complexity: based on the amount of memory required.

Temporal complexity can often
be traded for spatial complexity and vice versa; that is, we can often make an
algorithm use fewer primitive operations by having it store more values in
memory.
