    "- **Outcome**: possible result of a trial; one particular state of the world. What Laplace calls a case.\n",
    "For example: 4.\n",
    "- **Sample Space**: The set of all possible outcomes for the trial.\n",
    "For example, $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n",

    "For example, the event \"odd die roll\" is the set of outcomes $\\{1,3,5\\}$.\n",
    "- **Probability**: As Laplace said, the probability of an event with respect to\n",
    "  a sample space is the \"number of favorable cases\" (outcomes from the sample\n",
    "  space that are in the event) divided by the \"number of all the cases\" in the\n",
    "  sample space (assuming \"nothing leads us to expect that any one of these cases\n",
    "  should occur more than any other\"), so $P \\in [0,1]$.\n",
    "  For example, the probability of an odd die roll is $3/6 = 1/2$.\n",
    "- **Frequency**: non-negative number describing how often an outcome occurs. Can be a count like 5, or a ratio like 1/6.\n",
    "- **Distribution**: mapping from outcome to frequency of that outcome. We will allow sample spaces to be distributions. \n",
    "- **Probability Distribution**: distribution whose frequencies sum to 1. \n"
